## Project Goals

The primary goal for this project was to edit the existing homepage for Horiseon Social Solution Services to improve its accessibility features and overall semantic structure. The secondary goal was to fix any broken page components and refactor the page's HTML and CSS documents to reduce repetition and improve readability.

## Improved Accessibility Features

* **Semantic HTML Structure:** Replaced generic container elements and class names with appropriate semantic elements and semantic class names.
* **Page Headings:** Ensured that heading elements followed a logical, sequential order.
* **Improved Image Accessibility:** Added **alt** attributes to `<img>` tags to improve the experience of users visiting the page using assisitive technology.
* **Page Title:** Added keyword driven page title to `<title>` element to improve SEO and help users with disabilities more quickly understand the page's content and purpose.

## Technologies Used

* HTML

## Page Preview

While the updates made to Horiseon's home page did not alter its overall appearance, the refactored structure underneath the page more clearly articulates the role each section plays in the document as a whole.
